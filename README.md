# Microsoft Defender for Identity Configuration Checker

Per request, I created a Microsoft Defender for Identity Configuration Checker, which includes a Graphical User Interface. I can not make it simpler than this to check the Microsoft Defender for Identity configuration. Simply run the tool and check the dashboard to ensure everything is configured correctly. The buttons in the menu give a more granular view of the configuration per item.

# Usage Microsoft Defender for Identity Configuration Checker

If the items on the dashboard look happy and not greyed-out, the item is configured correctly. If the item does not look happy and is greyed-out, use the menu on the left to see what is not configured corectly.

Tip: Use the top panel to drag the window.
